# Minimalist to-do App (React & TypeScript)

Simple, offline capable task manager.

## Why It's Useful

* **No login required:** Works instantly in any browser.
* **Persists locally:** Uses `localStorage` to save tasks.
* **Zero frills or fluff:** Dead simple usage and design.

* ## Features

* Add, remove, and mark tasks as complete.
* Organize tasks by categories.
* Bulk delete selected tasks.
* Responsive design for various devices.

## Tech Used

* **React:** For building the user interface.
* **TypeScript:** For adding type safety to the JavaScript codebase.
* **Vite:** As the development and build tool.
* **CSS Grid/Flexbox:** For layout and responsive design.


## Notes

This version of the simple to-do app was built so I could learn and practice with **React** and **TypeScript**.
Having previously created a very similar simple to-do app with plain Javascript, CSS and HTML I decided to recreate
it with a modern JS framework and also try my hand at TypeScript.
